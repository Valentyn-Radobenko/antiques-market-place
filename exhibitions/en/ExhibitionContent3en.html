    History of VLP: Origins and Influence
  </h4>
  <p class="exhibition__content-article-text">
    The VLP group was founded in the early 1980s and has since become a symbol
    of French street art. Today, VLP members Michel Espagnol and Jean Gabaret
    continue to inspire new generations of artists. Their contribution to the
    development of urban art is difficult to overestimate: from the first
    aerosol drawings in the Galles district to prestigious exhibitions in the
    world's leading museums and galleries.
